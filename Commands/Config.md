# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git configt commands in order to set up your indentity.

For example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as:

``` git config -- global user.name "Said Ali"                                         git config --global.user.email alisaidmoha1@gmail.com ```

For more information, view the [first time setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
