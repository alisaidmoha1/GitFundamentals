# git status

The command `git status` is extremly helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of you repository.

Using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, are not been tracked, what commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc.

It is exactly what is sounds like, a status check.

```
git add .
git status

git commit -m "Modified landing page"
git status

git push
git status
```
